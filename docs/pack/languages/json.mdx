:::tip
You actually don't need this website as much to write JSON pack because we provide very rigorous JSON schemas in the [umi_json](https://github.com/cherryridge/umi_json) repository. You can use any JSON editor that supports JSON schema validation to write your `manifest.json` and other JSON files.
