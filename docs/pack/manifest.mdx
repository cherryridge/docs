# Manifest

The core of content pack is the `manifest.json` file. It contains:

1. The basic information of the content pack like identities and human readable information.
2. The configuration of the content pack which applies globally in this pack.
3. The dependencies and incompatibilities of the content pack.
4. The abilities provided by the content pack.

## Format Version

This is also one of CherryGrove's design principles: every version is just a `u64`.

## Metadata

These fields are for human and are optional, but recommended to fill in. They will be shown to users in various places.

## Compatibility

These fields are required and are used to ensure compatibility between content packs and the engine, as well as between content packs.

## Abilities

If you have been to Bedrock Addon development, you may be familiar with the God `main.js` where you constantly forgetting to import your newly created scripts. In CherryGrove, you can forget adding abilities in your `manifest.json` file. Cool, right?
