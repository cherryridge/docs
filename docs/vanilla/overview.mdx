# CherryGrove Vanilla

The `vanilla` content pack provides players with the default experience of CherryGrove. In my perspective, it preserves the essence of Minecraft while enhancing it with additional features and fixes that improve gameplay without altering too many core mechanics.

## Highlights

- Various workstations: One of the most annoying aspects of Minecraft is most of the items are being crafted at a single thing that only have nine slots and obtainable in the first 10 seconds. We have split the whole crafting system by aspect and progress, and even require a valid structure to be built for some of them instead of just placing one block.
- A whole ton of building blocks: Thanks to block templating, we can add a lot of custom permutation based blocks into the game, making it easier to build.
