# Contributing to Vanilla

## Provide Feedbacks

Found a bug? Just open an issue in [the Vanilla repository](https://github.com/cherryridge/vanilla) with the `bug` template, or fix it and open a lovely pull request!

## Contribute Ideas

Want some features? We welcome suggestions, but they are not guaranteed to be implemented into Vanilla. Remember that we are opinionated in Vanilla, and you can always create your own content pack with your ideas and enjoy it, or share it with the world.

To contribute ideas, open an issue in [the Vanilla repository](https://github.com/cherryridge/vanilla) with `feature` template.

:::note
We will not accept most of (if not every) parity suggestions with Minecraft. We are not a Minecraft clone, and we are not trying to be one. If you want to remake it, just start a new content pack project on your own.

## Create Assets

As you can see, most of our artworks are just programmer art.

We will honor you if you're willing to create more images/recordings for Vanilla!
