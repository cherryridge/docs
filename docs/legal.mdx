## Introduction

The founder of CherryGrove, [LJM12914](https://github.com/ljm12914#:~:text=It%27s%20a%20shame%20of%20open%20source%20to%20allow%20unrewarded%20commercial%20use.), don't like the situation and the definition of open source projects being used for commercial purposes without any compensation to the original developers:

> It's a shame of open source to allow unrewarded commercial use.
>
> LJM12914

#### So CherryGrove is a source available project. CherryGrove is NOT an open source project, and LJM12914 thinks this is NOT the fault of CherryGrove but the fault of open source definition's high expectations of human society.
