# CGR Files

A CGR (compressed CherryGrove relocatable game save) file is a compressed folder that contains one or more serialized relocatble world data files in the format of CGNBT in `.cgb` files, and a `manifest.json` file that contains metadata about the structures.

The common use cases are:

1. To place structures in structure generation requests in content packs, to avoid setting blocks repeatedly and manually.
2. To share structures with other players, similar to `.mcstructure` files in Minecraft.

## `manifest.json`

Example of `manifest.json`:

```json
{
    "formatVersion": 1,
    "cgr": {
        "namespace": "cg_town", //Optional if used in content packs
        "name": "Town Square", //Optional
        "description": "Sturcture pieces for town square.", //Optional
        "structures": [
            {
                "identifier": "square_center_fountain",
                "file": "center_fountain.cgb", //Optional if filename is the same as identifier
            },
            {
                "identifier": "square_center_tree",
                "file": "center_tree.cgb"
            },
            {
                "identifier": "square_center_palette",
                "file": "center_palette.cgb"
            },
            {
                "identifier": "square_flooring_bricks",
                "file": "flooring_bricks.cgb"
            },
            {
                "identifier": "square_flooring_dirt",
                "file": "flooring_dirt.cgb"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Access structure objects in code using identifier `cg_town:square_center_fountain` if namespace is specified, otherwise `square_center_fountain`.

## Folder Structure

Flat structure and subfolders are supported.
