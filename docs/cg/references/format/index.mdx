# File Formats

The files used (will be processed) by CherryGrove can be roughly divided into [text files](#text-file-formats) and [binary files](#binary-file-formats).

Currently CherryGrove uses the file formats below:

## Text File Formats

### `.txt`

CherryGrove uses it for simple configuration data storage.

### `.json`

CherryGrove uses it to store configurations and content packs uses it to mod the game directly or to store data.

Also, `manifest.json` is used to identify whatever folders of interest, such as content packs or relocatable world saves.

### `.js`

Content pack code files.

### `.lua`

Content pack code files.

## Binary File Formats

### `.cgb`

General [CGNBT (CherryGrove Named Binary Tag)](format/cgnbt) files.

### `.wasm`

Content pack code files.

## Binary File Formats (Compressed)

### `.cgw`

Compressed CherryGrove world folder, similar to `.mcworld`.

### `.cgp`

Compressed CherryGrove content pack folder, similar to `.mcaddon`/`.mcpack`.

### `.cgr`

CherryGrove relocatable game save, similar to schematic or `.mcstructure`, but is a compressed folder with `manifest.json` that indexes potentially multiple `.cgb` stored structures.

### `.zip`

CherryGrove will try to recognize `.zip` files as `.cgw`, `.cgp`, or `.cgr` files.

### `.7z`

CherryGrove will try to recognize `.7z` files as `.cgw`, `.cgp`, or `.cgr` files.

### `.tar.gz` / `.tgz`

CherryGrove will try to recognize `.tar.gz` / `.tgz` files as `.cgw`, `.cgp`, or `.cgr` files.

### `.zst` / `.tar.zst`

CherryGrove will try to recognize `.zst` / `.tar.zst` files as `.cgw`, `.cgp`, or `.cgr` files.
