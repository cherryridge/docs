# Building CherryGrove

This tutorial will help you build CherryGrove on your own machine. This is also a very good starting point for developing CherryGrove.

CherryGrove is still in a very early stage of development. Please check CherryGrove's currently [supported platforms](../overview#supported-platforms) before you move on.

## Introduction

CherryGrove currently uses the CMake build system only. We use the following dependency management strategies:

- For header-only libraries, we use Git submodules and CMake's `target_include_directories` to include them automatically.
- For CMake compatible libraries, we use Git submodules and CMake's `add_subdirectory` command to import it. You also don't need to manage them on your own.
- For libraries that are meant to be downloaded and compiled with the project, we commit them into our repository and build them together with other source files. Get more information at [Local Libraries Documentation](https://github.com/cherryridge/CherryGrove/blob/main/libs/README.md).
- For other libraries, we use GitHub Actions to build them in advance, and **you need to grab them from the corresponding repositories, or CherryGrove won't build successfully**.

## Prerequisites

### Build Toolchain

:::warning
Prebuilt dependencies assume linkage against the platform's default C++ Standard Library:

- Windows: MSVC, Microsoft STL
- Linux: GCC, libstdc++
- MacOS: Clang, libc++

Building CherryGrove using incorrect C++ Standard Library will result in an ABI conflict while linking. Please build the prebuilt dependencies manually if you really need another standard library.

<Tabs groupId="os">
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
        It's recommended to use Microsoft Visual Studio or Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to build CherryGrove on Windows. And also, it's recommended to use the MSVC toolchain.

        To get the toolchain, download the Microsoft Visual Studio installer from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com.

        Check **Desktop development with C++** in **Desktop & Mobile** section workload upon installing.

        If you need to target a different architecture (e.g. targetting arm64 Windows on x64 Windows), you should switch to **Individual components** and check the MSVC component for the other architecture (e.g. `MSVC v1xx - VS 20xx C++ ARM64/ARM64EC build tools (latest)`).

          - If you prefer VS Code:

            Download and install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com.
            
            Install [C/C++ Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) from Extensions Marketplace.

            <details>
                <summary>Install [CMake Tools Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) from Extensions Marketplace.</summary>
                <div>
                If you don't want to manually type in commands for building and debugging, configure the extension so it shows buttons in the status bar:

                ```json
                "cmake.options.statusBarVisibility": "icon"
                ```
                </div>
            </details>

            **(Optional)** Install [CMake Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake) from Extensions Marketplace for better CMake intellisense.

            **(Optional)** Install [C/C++ Themes Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-themes) for better C++ syntax highlighting.

            <details>
                <summary>**(Optional)** Install [clangd Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd) for better C++ language features in further development.</summary>
                <div>
                You also need to install `clangd` binary on your system. Download it from https://github.com/clangd/clangd/releases, or just use the automatic installation prompt from the extension, because the extension sometimes won't work with the latest clangd and you need to find the latest compatible one in O(n) yourself.

                After installing `clangd` manually, set up system PATH variable to include `clangd`'s installation directory, and configure VS Code to disable C/C++ Extension's IntelliSense engine to avoid conflicts:

                ```json
                "C_Cpp.intelliSenseEngine": "disabled"
                ```

                Clangd needs `compile_commands.json` to provide accurate language features. You can generate it using the CMake Tools Extension by adding this to your `settings.json`:

                ```json
                "cmake.copyCompileCommands": "${workspaceFolder}/compile_commands.json",
                "clangd.arguments": [
                    //(Optional) Always index files even you don't open them
                    "--background-index",
                    //Point to `compile_commands.json` in the root directory
                    "--compile-commands-dir=${workspaceFolder}"
                ]
                ```
                </div>

                After setting up, send a `Cmake: Configure` command to generate `compile_commands.json`, and restart VS Code. Clangd should be working to generate caches now.
            </details>

          - If you're using Microsoft Visual Studio *(you're probably not preferring it)*:

            Go through the MSVC toolchain installation process and launch Visual Studio, then open the `cherrygrove` folder using **Open a local folder**, or click **Open with Visual Studio** in File Explorer.

            Visual Studio should automatically detect `CMakeLists.txt` and `CMakePresets.json`, and start generating the f\*\*king `linux-arm64-debug` configuration for you. Stop it by switching to another configuration like `windows-x64-debug`, but don't switch too fast or it will somehow break the process and fail to generate. Good luck.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
        It's recommended to use GCC to build CherryGrove on Linux.

        For example in Ubuntu, `gcc` and `g++` in the registry are actually really old versions of them. As for 2025, install `gcc-14` and `g++-14` on your system and set alternatives to get a more complete C++20 environment:

        ```bash
        sudo apt install gcc-14 g++-14
        sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-14 100
        sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-14 100
        ```
        Then verify the version of `gcc` and `g++`:

        ```bash
        gcc --version
        g++ --version
        ```
        You should see `14.x.x` as the version.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
        It's recommended to use XCode or CLion to build CherryGrove on MacOS. The tutorial below will use CLion.

        Install CLion and TODO: MacOS
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### CMake

<Tabs groupId="os">
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
        Download and install CMake at https://cmake.org.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
        Install CMake from your distro's package manager, for example in Ubuntu:

        ```bash
        sudo apt install cmake
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
        Download and install CMake at https://cmake.org, or install it from Homebrew:

        ```bash
        brew install cmake
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Check if CMake is installed using:

```bash
cmake --version
```

### Git

Since CherryGrove uses Git submodules, it's recommended to clone the repository using Git, rather than downloading zip from GitHub webpage.

<Tabs groupId="os">
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
        Download and install Git at https://git-scm.org.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
        Install Git from your distro's package manager, for example in Ubuntu:

        ```bash
        sudo apt install git
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
        Download and install Git at https://git-scm.org, or install it from Homebrew:

        ```bash
        brew install git
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Check if Git is installed using:

```bash
git --version
```

### Ninja

CherryGrove uses Ninja as low level build system on all platforms by default because of its compatibility and versability. If you don't want to use Ninja, don't be worry. C++ toolchain is a wonderful place and many IDEs come with Ninja / can add Ninja as a workload such as Microsoft Visual Studio and CLion.

Install ninja according to your OS:

<Tabs groupId="os">
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
        Download Ninja at https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases, and put it somewhere. Then set up system PATH variable to include Ninja's directory.

        Check if Ninja is installed using:

        ```bash
        ninja --version
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
        Download and install Ninja at https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases, or use your package manager, for example in Ubuntu:

        ```bash
        sudo apt install ninja-build
        ```

        Check if Ninja is installed using:

        ```bash
        ninja --version
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
        Download and install Ninja at https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases, or install it from Homebrew:

        ```bash
        brew install ninja
        ```

        Check if Ninja is installed using:

        ```bash
        ninja --version
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### NASM

CherryGrove uses `SDL_image` dependency to support AVIF texture input format, which involves compiling x86 assembly, so we need a x86 assembly compiler on x86 builds. NASM is recommended: https://nasm.us.

<Tabs groupId="os">
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
        Get NASM at https://nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/?C=M;O=D: click on the latest version (the top one without `rc`), go into `win64` and download the `nasm-<version>-installer-x64.exe` installer. Run the installer and follow the instructions.

        Check if NASM is installed using:

        ```bash
        nasm -v
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
        Use your package manager to install NASM, for example in Ubuntu:

        ```bash
        sudo apt install nasm
        ```

        Check if NASM is installed using:

        ```bash
        nasm -v
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
        Install NASM from Homebrew:

        ```bash
        brew install nasm
        ```

        Check if NASM is installed using:

        ```bash
        nasm -v
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 7-zip

You will need 7z-compatible compression software to decompress downloaded prebuilt dependencies.

<Tabs groupId="os">
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
        Download and install 7-zip at https://7-zip.org. Then, set up system PATH variable to include 7-zip's installation directory (e.g. `C:\Program Files\7-Zip`) if you want to use the prebuilt dependency fetching scripts.

        If you're using Windows 11 22H2 or later versions of Windows and you don't want to use the fetch scripts, you don't need to install anything. Doubleclicking the downloaded `.7z` files and extracting using File Explorer should just work.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
        Install `p7zip` from your distro's package manager, for example in Ubuntu:

        ```bash
        sudo apt install p7zip
        ```
        Check if 7z is installed using:

        ```bash
        7z
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
        Install `p7zip` from Homebrew:

        ```bash
        brew install p7zip
        ```
        Check if 7z is installed using:

        ```bash
        7z
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Clone Repository

Remember to use the `--recursive` argument. Cloning might take several minutes to complete because of the large submodule tree.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cherryridge/cherrygrove.git
```

## Grab Prebuilt Depedencies

Currently we have five prebuilt dependencies that **need to be downloaded separately** from GitHub Action's release. All of the archives from these releases are compressed using 7-Zip. You can download them all from running this script in `cherrygrove/libs` folder:

<Tabs groupId="os">
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
        ```bash
        cd libs
        ./fetch_prebuilt_libs.ps1
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
        ```bash
        cd libs
        ./fetch_prebuilt_libs.sh
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
        ```bash
        cd libs
        ./fetch_prebuilt_libs.sh
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You will need `7z` in your PATH for the scripts to work.

You will probably need to download both `debug` and `release` builds if you want to set up a development environment. If you only want to build CherryGrove and use it, only download `release` builds.

:::note
#### Tips about bgfx's `shaderc`

1. The bgfx dependency has a shader compiler (`shaderc`) in it, which will be invoked post-build. If you see some errors about execution permission, you might need to run `chmod +x lib/bgfx/<debug|release>/shaderc`.
2. On Windows arm64, shader compiler (`shaderc.exe`) is actually an x64 build because of some weird incompatibility errors building it targetting arm64 Windows. It should work fine unless you're using an older version of arm64 Windows 10, which is really rare.
:::

Links, in case you need to download these dependencies manually:

1. `bgfx`: https://github.com/cherryridge/dep_bgfx/releases/latest
2. `SoLoud`: https://github.com/cherryridge/dep_soloud/releases/latest
3. `LuaJIT`: https://github.com/cherryridge/dep_luajit/releases/latest
3. `V8`: https://github.com/cherryridge/dep_v8/releases/latest
3. `Wasmtime`: https://github.com/cherryridge/dep_wasmtime/releases/latest

Upon decompressing, the files inside should look like this:

```
├───📁 include/
│   ├───📁 <dependency_name>/ (optional)
│   │   └───...
│   ├───📁 <dependency_name2>/ (optional)
│   │   └───...
│   └───📄 (...).<h|hpp|hh> (optional)
├───📄 <library_name>.<lib|a>
├───📄 <library_name>.pdb (optional)
├───📄 <library_name2>.<lib|a> (optional)
└───📄 VERSION.txt
```

Put all of the files and folders into `libs/<dependency_name>/<debug|release>`. You should see a `.gitignore` file inside each destination folder before putting files in, which stops Git from tracking these files.

### Additional Dependencies for Linux

For Linux, there are some additional dependencies you also need to install. In Ubuntu, run this command to install them:

```bash
sudo apt install pkg-config libx11-dev libwayland-dev wayland-protocols libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libgl1-mesa-dev x11proto-core-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libgl-dev libasound2-dev libjack-jackd2-dev liblz4-dev libzstd-dev
```

<Tabs groupId="os">
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
        If you are using CLion, enable `windows-<architecture>-<mode>` profiles in Open Project Wizard, and press OK. Wait for CLion to generate build system files.

        If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio, open it up and choose Open a local folder, then select `cherrygrove`, or in blank window (continue without code) choose File > Open > Folder... / CMake..., then select `cherrygrove` or `cherrygrove\CMakeLists.txt`.

        Wait for it to generate a solution. Switch to `windows-<architecture>-<mode>` configurations if needed.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
        Generate build system files (which is `gmake` in most cases) from CMake using these commands, notice that `gmake` is a single-configuration build system, so specify build mode:

        ```bash
        cd cherrygrove
        mkdir out
        cd out
        cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug|Release> ..
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
        If you are using CLion, 

        If not, generate XCode build system files from CMake using these commands: (Yep XCode doesn't come with Ninja)

        ```bash
        cd cherrygrove
        mkdir out
        cd out
        cmake ..
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Build

You can deduce your build system by the software you're using, or by the build system files generated inside of `out` directory. If you're using an IDE, it may put subfolders of `<os>-<architecture>-<mode>` inside `out` directory instead of putting everything directly in `out`, and so does the commands and the products.

<Tabs groupId="buildsystem">
    <TabItem value="vs" label="Visual Studio">
        Ensure the configuration is correctly generated, then switch build target to **CherryGrove.exe** and choose **Build > Build CherryGrove.exe**.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="clion" label="CLion">
        Enable `<os>-<architecture>-<mode>` profiles in Open Project Wizard, and press OK. Wait for CLion to generate build files.

        Ensure the configuration is correct, then choose your desired profile and choose **Build 'CherryGrove'**.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="xcode" label="XCode">
        If you're using XCode IDE, open the generated `.xcworkspace` or `.xcodeproj` in Xcode. Adjust Scheme in the top toolbar, select the desired build mode configuration, If you're using it through the command line, run:

        ```bash
        #TODO: MacOS
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="make" label="Make/GMake">
        Generate build system files from CMake using these commands:

        ```bash
        cd cherrygrove
        mkdir out
        cd out
        cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug|Release> ..
        ```

        Run this command in `out` directory to build:

        ```bash
        make
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="ninja" label="Ninja">
        Generate build system files from CMake using these commands:

        ```bash
        cd cherrygrove
        mkdir out
        cd out
        cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug|Release> ..
        ```

        Run this command in `out` directory to build:

        ```bash
        ninja -C CherryGrove
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Product Explanation

For default CMake presets, the products are located in `out/<os>-<architecture>-<mode>`. CherryGrove is monolithic, i.e. everything is in the `CherryGrove` executable, **but except for:**

1. Shaders in `shaders` folder.
2. Assets in `assets` folder.

Copying `assets`, `shaders` and `CherryGrove` executable to another place and they should just work.

## Troubleshooting

### Downloading

1. It takes forever to clone CherryGrove
    - Unfortunately there is no way to fix this because CherryGrove simply uses a lot of Git submodules and they also have many submodules inside of them. Under a typical network environment, cloning CherryGrove would take 1~5mins.

2. Server timeout/unexpected EOF/other network issues while cloning
    - Simply retry using a better network. It's recommended to remove any downloaded files before retrying.
    - Consider using a proxy for Git. Git in command prompt/bash won't automatically pick up system proxy, so you might need to configure it using:
        ```bash
        git config --global http.proxy <proxy_host>
        git config --global https.proxy <proxy_host>
        ```
    - If you're still not able to clone CherryGrove using command line, you are in *really* bad luck: **You need to manually download code from GitHub.com webpage recursively for every Git submodule dependencies, as well as the dependencies of these dependencies**. You are a legend if you managed to do so.

### Building

1. CMake failed to generate project files
    - If you're using Linux, and the error message contains `not found`, check if you had installed the [OS-specific dependencies](#additional-dependencies-for-linux).
    - If the error message contains `CMAKE_ASM_NASM_COMPILER`, [download the NASM compiler](#nasm).

### Testing

1. CherryGrove won't start
    :::warning
    It's a known bug that CherryGrove won't start under a directory path that has non-ASCII characters.
    :::
    - Try to locate and inspect log files like `CherryGrove-<timestamp>.log` in `logs` folder near the executable. If you believe that a bug had occured, consider reporting to us.
    - You can also try to debug using your IDE.

2. The GUI is in a bad shape / is flickering / is wrongly scaled / won't respond to resizing
    - CherryGrove is still in a very early stage of development. For now (2025.11), that's pretty normal. At least you saw something happening :).
