# Packing CherryGrove

This tutorial will help you pack the installer of CherryGrove for each platform. All packing related resources are located under the `packing` directory.

:::warning
Remember to abide by the [terms](../../legal) when you want to distribute your builds.
:::

## Microsoft Windows

CherryGrove currently uses NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) to pack for installer on Microsoft Windows. Download and install it at: https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download.

NSIS uses `.nsi` script files to build the installer, which can be found at `packing/windows`. If you want to do a standard packing procedure, follow these steps:

1. Build the **release** version of CherryGrove.
2. Run `packing/windows/pack.bat` and wait for all language varieties to be built.

Adjust the code in the scripts to create your custom procedures.

## Linux

CherryGrove currently uses AppImage to pack images for all Linux Distros.

## MacOS

CherryGrove uses create-dmg to pack images on MacOS.
