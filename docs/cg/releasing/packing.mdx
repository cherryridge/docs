# Packing CherryGrove

This tutorial will help you pack the files and generate the installer / package for each platform. All packing related resources are located under the `packing` directory.

:::warning
Remember to abide by the [Terms of Use](../../legal#terms-of-use) when you want to distribute your builds.
:::

## Microsoft Windows

CherryGrove currently uses Inno Setup to pack for installer on Microsoft Windows. Download and install it at https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php.

Inno Setup uses `.iss` script files to build the installer, which can be found at `packing/windows`. If you want to do a standard packing procedure, follow these steps:

1. Build the **release** version of CherryGrove, and check if it works properly and locates **exactly** at `out/windows-x64-release` directory.
2. Run `packing/windows/pack.bat`. You should see an installer file `CherryGrove_setup_win64.exe` generated inside the same directory.

Adjust the code in the script to create your custom procedure.

## Linux

CherryGrove currently uses AppImage to pack images for all Linux Distros.

## MacOS

CherryGrove uses create-dmg to pack images on MacOS.
