# Accounts

We are a *basically FOSS* project and we don't charge for anything if you don't charge others for anything. So why do we need accounts? Yes, they're mainly for multiplayer.

## Decentralized Authorities

We don't want to limit the authority to only ourselves. That's a problem when Mojang's authentication servers are fragile and everyone can't play multiplayer when they're down.

But how are we going to distinguish players from different servers? The answer is simple: we use the server's identity combined with the player's identity, which is inspired by Mastodon's "appending server name behind username" approach, and we actually don't care about legitimacy of the authentication

## In-Game Behavior

In the game we only care about the UUID of the account which is generated by the server and will never collide with other players or other entities.
