# CherryGrove

CherryGrove is a block game framework (or engine, if you like). It comes with little built-in gameplay functionalities but a ton of modding features, making it highly customizable and suitable for meta creating your own block game where your can build your dream world or experience a wonderful surviving journey.

CherryGrove is designed to be cross-platform, efficient, and modern-oriented. It is written in modern C++ and uses modern libraries.
 
CherryGrove is designed to be free and source available software **with commercial use restrictions in mind**. More of it comes in the [Legal](../legal) page. TL;DR tables: [FAQ](faq#licensing).

\*: V8 currently can't run on WASM platform. If so, it will be able to effectively run on itself, which is awesome but not now.

^: We have dropped x86 and arm32 because it's just outdated and not worth the limited resource. Theoretically it's able to compile and run, but some mysterious and unexplainable bugs may occur.

^^: We need more investment for the project to bring it to App Store.
